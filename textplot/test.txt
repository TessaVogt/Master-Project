This project focuses on the development of a 
system that uses the Anycubic i3 Mega 3D printer 
to produce personalized text in a customized 
handwriting font. The primary objective is to 
employ the 3D printer as a plotter to accurately 
write text in a specified font on a suitable 
surface. Additionally, the focus lies on the 
generation of a unique font that closely 
resembles the user's own handwriting, using a 
scan of the handwritten script as a foundation. 
The result will be evaluated based on its 
similarity to a human handwriting and how much
it differs from a computer-generated handwriting.
