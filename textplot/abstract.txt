This study focuses on developing a system 
that enables the Anycubic i3 Mega 3D 
printer to write texts with a ballpoint 
pen on a suitable medium. A pen holder was 
designed using CAD to attach the pen to
the printer's nozzle, and Python code was 
implemented to read a proprietary font 
file and generate print instructions for 
the 3D printer based on the given font file. 
Additionally, the personal handwriting of 
multiple individuals was captured, and custom 
font files were created to replicate their 
individual handwriting. These custom font 
files replaced the predefined font file, 
enabling the 3D printer to write texts in 
personalized handwriting. The success of 
this implementation was evaluated by 
comparing the handwritten texts with the 
texts written by the 3D printer.
